# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game **Tic-Tac-Toe**. The game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to mark their positions on the board. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- Interactive gameplay for two players (`X` and `O`).
